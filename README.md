# visual-analytics
### visual analytics course taught by Prof. Giuseppe Santucci @ Sapienza

## Main Rules

- Final assignment - 25 Marks.
- Positioning with respect to the literature - 5 Marks.

> I'm one person so I'll go with a free proposal.

- Preliminary proposal is required before starting. An email to Prof. Santucci and Dr. Angelini in cc is required. It must be a one page draft with following information:

. Specify the dataset (characteristics and context).
. Specify the general idea.
. Specify the used analytics.
. A mockup of the user interface.
. Specify various characteristics in relation to the visual analytics cycle.

### Characteristics
1 - Every assignment must use a PCA or MDS or t-SNE algorithm in order to
    preprocess the dataset for choosing the right dimensions.
    Having it integrated as analytics part.
2 - Dimensionality reduction not integrated with the analysis flow will cause a penalty of 2 points.
3 - Mandatory - Visualization: Every assignment must have visual part with atleast 2 visualizations but need to be interactive.
> `4 - Analytics: every assignment MUST contain at least 1 computation that is
triggered by user visual interactions (no change in the dataset, no simple filter, no
simple selection from a menu)
    • Not addressing this requirement will cause a penalty of 5 points`


_** HOMEWORK POSITIONING **_
. Analysis of related papers related to the homework.
    similar techincal solution
    similar objectives
    similar dataset
. Discussion of:
    related proposals
    related techniques
    differences with respect to the homework
. Prefer to look into:
    google scholar
    IEEE
    ACM digital library

## DATASETS

Sports, bitcoin, blockchain, network traffic data analysis, your own proposed dataset.
The Dataset MUST respect the rule that the index AS (AngeliniSantucci) defined
as:

    http://dati-censimentoindustriaeservizi.istat.it/

    https://www.dati.gov.it/view-dataset
    
    http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings

    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets


> `AS= #tuples * #dimensions`

is contained in the range 10000 – 50000 (and more for the braves.....)

# What's Needed?

1 - Running software
2 - A relation similar to a scientific paper that describes the whole design process, retionale, and prototype, comprehensive related work section that descibes the related papers and the discovered insigts in the a specific section.
3 - A powerpoint presentation describing the goal of the homework, the data structure, and the chosen visualizations(without interactions).

# What's exam?
1 - Preseting the powerpoint material.
2 - Giving a live demo of the system.
3 - Answering questions on the both presentation and demo.

# Evaluation Criteria
`A well crafted system composed of 3 refined visualizations, highly coordinated
and interactive, and with good analytical functions is BETTER than a 10
visualization dashboard with limited interaction and no analytics
implemented`

# Avoid Pitfalls:

• Not standard color encodings (2 points penalty)

• Missing legend(s) (2 points penalty)

• Scrollable views not justified by design constraints (2 points penalty)

• Too strong reuse of existing solutions (2 points penalty)

• Examples of past good and bad projects have been presented during the course

. Missing dimensionality reduction (the project is not evaluated)

• Missing two coordinated visualizations (5 points penalty)

• Missing related work (5 points penalty)

• Dimensionality reduction NOT integrated in the analysis flow (2 points penalty)

• Not standard color encodings (2 points penalty)

• Missing legends (2 points penalty)

• Scrollable views not justified by design constraints (2 points penalty)

• Too strong reuse of existing solutions (2 points penalty)

• Missing insights (2 points penalty)

• Missing intended system user (2 points penalty)
